# Script documentation Template
## What is this script for?
This is a template that can be copied and pasted to fill out documentation for the various scripts we use in the pudendal project. Under this heading, provide a general description of the purpose of the script and note key knowledge critical to properly using the script.

## Dependencies
- [[link to some class or function used in the current script]] from [[link to some other script from which the class or function originates]]

## Classes (include if script has classes)
### SampleClass (class)
- Give a description of what the class is and what it is used for.

#### Parameters:
- **Parameter_Name_in_Bold**: Description of parameter

#### Class Methods:
##### sampleClassMethod:
-  **Parameters**: List class method parameters here
- **Summary**: Succinct summary of what the method is intended to do 
- **Step-by-step**:
	- List the steps the method is taking to achieve its goal in plain english
	- try to provide the big picture as if explaining to someone who might be unfamiliar with the programming language
	- only state packages being used if they are niche (such as NEURON) but not if they are common (for example, NumPy). 
	- Additionally, link to relevant documentation when possible. For example: [NEURON model file](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/py_doc/modelspec/programmatic/mechanisms/nmodl.html)  


## Functions (include if script has stand alone functions)
### sampleFunction
-  **Parameters**
	- *param_name_italicized:* Description of parameter
- **Description**
	- Description of function's purpose

- **Step-by-Step**
	- List the steps the method is taking to achieve its goal in plain english
	- try to provide the big picture as if explaining to someone who might be unfamiliar with the programming language
	- only state packages being used if they are niche (such as NEURON) but not if they are common (for example, NumPy). 
	- Additionally, link to relevant documentation when possible. For example: [NEURON model file](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/py_doc/modelspec/programmatic/mechanisms/nmodl.html)  

## Suggestions for improvement
- If you spot potential improvements in performance or readability, feel free to list them here. This will be useful if we decide to refactor the code at a later date.

## Code I don't understand
- ```Here, copy paste any code portions that you are unsure what it does``` 
	- Here, include the line number in the file to make it easy to find later
	- Feel free to also list any thoughts that you think may be relevant later when reviewing  the confusing code with the rest of the group
