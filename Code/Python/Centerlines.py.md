# Centerlines.py
## What is this script for?
This is a template that can be copied and pasted to fill out documentation for the various scripts we use in the pudendal project. Under this heading, provide a general description of the purpose of the script and note key knowledge critical to properly using the script.

## Dependencies
- [pypes](http://www.vmtk.org/documentation/pypes.html) from [vmtk](http://www.vmtk.org/documentation/)
- [vmtkcenterlines](http://www.vmtk.org/vmtkscripts/vmtkcenterlines.html) from [vmtk](http://www.vmtk.org/documentation/)
- [vmtkcenterlinestonumpy]
- [vmtkscripts]

## Functionality (use if script is more functional than object oriented)
### Major Function 1
- Describe the major step in achieving major function one

### Major Function 2
- Describe the major step in achieving major function two
- 

## Output (use if the script outputs a file)
- Describe any outputs and their formatting, for example .txt files

## Tags
Here, you can add tags to the page to make it easier to track which pages touch on which topics. I am also using a #complete tag to denote which pages are complete.

## Suggestions for improvement
- The nested for-loop in lines 14-28  throws exceptions by design. This is bad practice since it makes it harder to understand what is going on. Changing the names variable to include all the valid filenames would fix this and make the code more concise.

## Code I don't understand
- ```Here, copy paste any code portions that you are unsure what it does``` 
	- Here, include the line number in the file to make it easy to find later
	- Feel free to also list any thoughts that you think may be relevant later when reviewing  the confusing code with the rest of the group
