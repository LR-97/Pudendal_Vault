# Obsidian Vault for the Pudendal Project
This is an obsidian vault to track components of the pudendal stimulation modeling project. Currently it is setup to serve as documentation for the various scripts used in the modeling pipeline. In the future it could be expanded to serve additional purposes, such as a literature review workspace.  
## Overview
## Organization
The modeling pipeline workflow is described in [[Pudendal Protocol]].

Documentation for scripts is stored in the Code folder and segregated according to the language the script is written in. 

A template for writing script documentation is provided [[template|here]].
